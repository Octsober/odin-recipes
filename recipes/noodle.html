    <img src="noodle.jpg" alt="vietnam pho">
    <p>This recipe is my attempt at the famous Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup, Pho. Garnish with thinly sliced raw beef tenderloin, basil, mint, cilantro, chili sambal, and fresh lime wedges.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 thick slices beef shank</li>
            <li>2 pounds beef oxtail, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 (6 inch) piece fresh ginger, sliced</li>
            <li>6 whole star anise</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package fresh rice noodles</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>3 quarts water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook beef shank, oxtail pieces, and ginger in hot oil, turning occasionally, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Add star anise, fennel seed, coriander seed, cloves, cinnamon stick, and cardamom pod to the pot and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Stir water, onion, garlic, white sugar, and bay leaf into beef mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until broth is flavorful and meat is falling off the bone, 5 to 6 hours. Remove meat and reserve. Strain broth into a pot; discard strained spices and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Chop beef shank meat and add to broth in pot; stir in fish sauce and soy sauce. Bring broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low to keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until noodles are softened, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water.</li>
            <li>Place a handful of bean sprouts in the bottom of a large soup bowl. Top with a large handful of prepared rice noodles and drop a few jalapeno slices over noodles. Ladle beef broth into bowl to cover noodles.</li>
        </ol>
